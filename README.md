# Smart-Home-System
Our project focuses on building a Smart Home Security System using Arduino to enhance home safety through basic automation and intrusion detection. The system is designed to monitor password entries for door access and respond to incorrect attempts with immediate alerts.
Password Entry System: A keypad is used to input the password. The Arduino verifies it against a predefined correct password.
Intrusion Detection: If the password entered is incorrect three times consecutively, the system identifies this as a potential intrusion.
Alarm Triggering: Upon detecting a wrong password entry, a buzzer alarm is activated to alert the household or neighbors.
LED Alerts: LED lights are used to indicate the system's status:
Green LED: Correct password (access granted)
Red LED: Incorrect password (access denied)
Blinking Red: Intrusion alert

Components Used:
Arduino Uno
4x4 Keypad
Buzzer
LEDs (Red and Green)
Resistors
Breadboard and connecting wires
Power supply

Applications:
Home door security
Office or lab access control
Basic building entry monitoring system
